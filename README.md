# Project Name: ***News API with Voice Output***

## Project & Work Product Description: 
### Project Goals 
    • Learn how to re-use packages
    • Learn to use REST APIs with Python
    • #1 Get it working
    • Get more news
    • Make sure the voice parts work

### Description of Business Problem:
    Short Paragraph description of what problem(s) you are trying to solve, things you are learning, or value you want to create.

### Solution Design (high-level):

### Solution Code Description: 
    •	Describe code (to help users understand it.)
    •	Hyperlinks to actual complete code  

## Lessons Learned: [optional here, can be put at the end.]

[ Hyperlinks to more detailed project description information can be linked to documents in subfolders in the github repository. ]:

## Application Use: ***(Instructions for How to Use The Software)*** 
    If your application applies to multiple use cases, list and briefly describe each major use case. 

## Description of Solution:
    •	Software functions for solving problem(s) step by step.
    •	Workflow diagram of future ("TO-BE") state (improved processes from your solution).
    •	"Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) 1.0 delivered.  (V1.x delivered beyond MVP V1.0?)
    •	Later MVP, i.e., v2, v3, vN+ functionality to be delivered? 
            • additional requirements, GUI, usability, etc. for later versions

### Application Use - ***Tips & Tricks***:    

    If it is not obvious or documentation is not built into the user interface (or written in a Jupyter Notebook), then briefly describe each major use case.  Minor variations can be left out. 
Additional Important Guidelines for Others to Use Your Work Product:

    If there are other important things you learned or know from using, applying, or developing your project code, then please let others know.  This can save people hours or days of time. 
    
    This can include details on any aspect of usage, including installation, dependencies of OS, platform, package dependencies, data source limitations, or simply Tips & Tricks for new users.

#### Example of how to display Python code properly highlighted.

```python
import yfinance as yf

msft = yf.Ticker("MSFT")

# get stock info
msft.info

# get historical market data
hist = msft.history(period="max")
```
